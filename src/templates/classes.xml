        <flavorText>Noble and inspiring, a paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladinâ€™s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</flavorText>
